There is a survey that consists of n questions where each question's answer is either 0 (no) or 1 (yes).

The survey was given to m students numbered from 0 to m - 1 and m mentors numbered from 0 to m - 1.
The answers of the students are represented by a 2D integer array students where students[i] is an integer array that contains the answers of the ith student (0-indexed).
The answers of the mentors are represented by a 2D integer array mentors where mentors[j] is an integer array that contains the answers of the jth mentor (0-indexed).

Each student will be assigned to one mentor, and each mentor will have one student assigned to them.
The compatibility score of a student-mentor pair is the number of answers that are the same for both the student and the mentor.

For example,
    if the student's answers were [1, 0, 1] and the mentor's answers were [0, 0, 1],
    then their compatibility score is 2 because only the second and the third answers are the same.

You are tasked with finding the optimal student-mentor pairings to maximize the sum of the compatibility scores.
Given students and mentors, return the maximum compatibility score sum that can be achieved.


Example 1:
    Input:
        students = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]],
        mentors = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
    Output:
        8
    Explanation:
        We assign students to mentors in the following way:
            - student 0 to mentor 2 with a compatibility score of 3.
            - student 1 to mentor 0 with a compatibility score of 2.
            - student 2 to mentor 1 with a compatibility score of 3.
            The compatibility score sum is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.

Example 2:
    Input:
        students = [[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]],
        mentors = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
    Output:
        0
    Explanation:
        The compatibility score of any student-mentor pair is 0.


Constraints:
    m == students.length == mentors.length
    n == students[i].length == mentors[j].length
    1 <= m, n <= 8
    students[i][k] is either 0 or 1.
    mentors[j][k] is either 0 or 1.
