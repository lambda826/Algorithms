Introduction

Driving to work is a nightmare in the Bay Area, so I decided to take CalTrain instead. However, the complicated train schedule gives me headache and I would like some of your help on this. I have got one of my friends here at Houzz to parse the schedule and pass me it to me as nicely formatted
data. Now, I need a program that interprets this data and gives me the optimal route to take.

WESTWOOD SANTAMONICA LAX

WESTWOOD SANTAMONICA 1000 1050
SANTAMONICA LAX 1100 1230 
WESTWOOD LAX 1130 1250 

WESTWOOD, LAX

I want the recommended route to satisfy the following conditions:

1. I will arrive at destination as early as possible, regardless of the departure time.
2. If I can take different routes that arrive at the same time, I will take the route that leaves as late as possible.

For now, your program only has to return a string that contains the departure time and the arrival time separated by a space, for example:

1000 1230

public class Route {

}
